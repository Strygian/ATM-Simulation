ATM PROJECT - What I Did
=========================

I built an ATM simulator for college. Here's what I made:

Data Classes (model folder):
- User.java: stores customer name, email, and when they were created
- Account.java: stores the balance, PIN, and if account is active
- Transaction.java: stores transaction info like type, amount, time, description

Database Classes (dao folder):
- DBConnection.java: connects Java to the SQLite database file
- UserDAO.java: saves and reads user data from database
- AccountDAO.java: saves and reads account data from database
- TransactionDAO.java: saves and reads transaction data from database
- DatabaseInit.java: creates the database tables and adds test data

Business Logic Classes (service folder):
- AuthService.java: handles login - checks if Account ID and PIN are correct
- ATMService.java: does the main ATM stuff - balance check, deposit, withdraw
- TransactionService.java: records what the user did in the transactions table

Menu Class (ui folder):
- ATMConsoleUI.java: the menu that appears on screen - login, operations menu, etc

Helper Classes (util folder):
- InputValidator.java: checks if the input is a number, valid pin, etc
- Logger.java: prints messages like [INFO], [ERROR], [WARN]

Database Structure:
- users table: stores customer name, email, created date
- accounts table: stores account balance, PIN, status (ACTIVE/LOCKED)
- transactions table: stores every deposit, withdrawal, balance check

Features that work:
✓ Login with Account ID and PIN
✓ Check current balance
✓ Deposit money (balance goes up)
✓ Withdraw money (balance goes down, but must keep $100 minimum)
✓ View transaction history (see last X transactions)
✓ Logout

How the program works:
1. Program starts and creates database/tables if needed
2. Shows main menu (Login or Exit)
3. User chooses Login
4. User enters Account ID and PIN
5. Program checks database if PIN matches
6. If correct, show operations menu
7. User picks what to do (balance, deposit, withdraw, history, logout)
8. Program updates database with whatever they did
9. Everything gets recorded as a transaction

Test Accounts that are automatically created:
- Account 1: ID=1, PIN=1234, Starting balance=$5000
- Account 2: ID=2, PIN=5678, Starting balance=$3500
- Account 3: ID=3, PIN=9012, Starting balance=$2500

What I learned:
- JDBC - how Java connects to databases
- SQLite - simple database that stores as a file
- Organizing code into packages (model, dao, service, ui)
- Scanner - how to read user input
- Try-catch - how to handle errors
- SQL - writing queries to insert, select, update data
- Database design - how to structure tables with relationships
