# ATM Simulation Database Configuration
# This file stores database connection parameters for SQLite

# JDBC URL - For SQLite, this can be a file path
# Example: jdbc:sqlite:atm_database.db (creates file in current directory)
# For production, consider using: jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/database/atm_database.db
db.jdbc.url=jdbc:sqlite:atm_database.db

# Database username (not needed for SQLite, but kept for compatibility)
db.username=

# Database password (not needed for SQLite, but kept for compatibility)
